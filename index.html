		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>Welcome! My name is Chelsea and I'm a junior in the Information Communication Technology program at UK. I'm currently working as a systems technician who performs a various smattering of Level I-IV tasks: DevOps, server administration, network monitoring, and delivering plain 'ol VIP customer service to clients. I'm always looking for ways to adapt and improve!</p>

		<h1>My Homelab</h1>
		<p>I genuinely love to learn, so I've put together a basic homelab in my tiny studio apartment to better grasp concepts of systems administration and network security. I'm actually working on a network diagram for my setup that I'll be adding to this section. Currently, I have a Dell Poweredge R410 running Windows Server 2016 that is functioning as a domain controller and virtualization server. In addition, I have several ancient Dell Optiplexes that I use as dummy workstations on my domain. Also, I have an older Asus box that I'll be using for PFSense (this isn't yet configured). I practice pretty much anything and everything on this thing. </p>
